<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Aim of this project was to build ATM machine software and a REST API server with database to store bank-related data. These softwares were programmed using techniques learned with Express.js, MySQL and Qt before this project course. Part of the aim was also handle project like a real world software project (only a lighter version) where are two parties involved: software deliverer and the customer.

Full documentation is not attached to this project page. Only the essential ones are attached e.g. ER-diagram, component diagram and class diagrams.
Following planning and documenting steps were made during the planning phase:

* Pre-study
* Project contract with the customer
* Functional description (includes use cases, user stories, ER-diagram)
* Technical implementation description (includes UML component diagram and class diagram)
* Final report

### Built With

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Data storage
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) REST API server
